# [open-source-market: find open source projects and collaborators](https://github.com/nosarthur/open-source-market)

## purpose

> The purpose of this repo is to help **novice programmers** to find open source
projects to work on, and help **project owners** to find contributors.

## tech stack

The MVP version uses

- github
- markdown
- mkdocs

Currently we are working on version 1 which uses

- django
- sqlite3
- gcloud
- docker

When the number of projects get large, we can use postgres for example.
If the project grows further, we can think about splitting the frontend part
using some javascript framework.

## timeline

- database models: 2 month
- html templates: 1 month

## communication

The preferred ways are

- [slack](https://opensourcemarket.slack.com/)
- github ecosystem
