## version 0

- serve static website generated by mkdocs
- new project from github pull request + maintainer approval

## version 1

- serve django app + postgres db
- deploy to google app engine

### milestone 0

This sub-version would appear like version 0.

- no db
- serve rendered project markdown files

### milestone 1

- user login
- project CRUD and view
- vote

### milestone 2

These features are less critical than the ones in milestone 1, and may only
make sense when the project number is large.

- comment
- ranking with decay
- pagination
- filtering based on category and time span

## version 2 (very tentative)

- move from google app engine to custom environment
- split frontend from backend
