# project roadmap

Overall, we should strive to obtain

- frequent deployment
- high test coverage
- decoupled modules

## version 0

- serve static website generated by mkdocs
- new projects: github pull request + maintainer approval

## version 1

- serve django app + postgres db
- deploy to google app engine

### milestone 0

This sub-version should look and behave the same as version 0.

- serve project markdown files from django
- accept new projects from PR

### milestone 1

- user login
- project CRUD and view
- vote

### milestone 2

These features are less critical than the ones in milestone 1, and only
makes sense with many projects.

- filtering based on category and time span
- ranking with decay
- pagination
- comment

## version 2 (very tentative)

- move from google app engine to custom environment
- split frontend from backend
