## What

This is a hacker news like web application, which aims to

- increase exposure of early stage open source project
- help novice developer find projects to work on

Currently, we focus on the following project categories

- data science
- developer tool
- web application

## Why

For a novice developer, guidance from experienced programmers is invaluable.
Tooling and engineering practices can be easily taught, but hard to learn by oneself.

However, it's hard to find beginner friendly projects.
One solution is to join a coding boot camp.
Plenty of such project exist in the open source world, they are just no known.

For project owner, the value of this platform is in

- attracting users and contributors
- polishing project management skills, such as
  - identify the sequential and parallelizable parts of the project.
  - communicate vision to team members and general public

## How

As an open source project, the man power comes from

- core development team (collaborators)
- other contributors

Cost is covered by project owner now, possibly by donation and sponsorship in the future.

- domain names: production and staging servers
- gcloud infrastructure
  - instance
  - database
