## What

This is a platform to

- help novice programmers find projects to work on
- increase exposure of early stage open source project

Currently, we focus on the following project categories

- data science
- developer tool
- web application

## Why

For a novice developer, guidance from experienced programmers is invaluable.
Tooling and engineering practices can be easily taught, but hard to learn by oneself.

However, it's hard to find beginner friendly projects.
Such projects exist in the open source world, they are just no known.

For project owners, the value of this platform is in

- attracting users and contributors
- mastering project management skills, such as
  - identify the sequential and parallelizable parts of the project.
  - divide/delegate work and estimate progress
  - communicate vision to team members and general public

## How

As an open source project, the engineering effort comes from

- core development team (collaborators)
- other contributors

Anyone who is willing to commit 2 hours/week can join the core development team.
